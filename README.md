# PrintNightmare
 
This is an adaptation of the original CVE-2021-1675 / CVE-2021-34527 python code from Cube0x0 (https://github.com/cube0x0/CVE-2021-1675) and the code that was Benjamin Deply incorporated into Mimikatz (https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz/).  Some of the PAR functionality was incorporated from byt3bl33d3r's ItWasAllADream (https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/ItWasAllADream).  

It allows for both MS-PAR and MS-RPRN.
